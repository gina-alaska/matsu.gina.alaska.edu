<h1>LAS Global Encoding Bit fix</h1>

<p class="alert alert-info">
This fix has now been applied to the <a href="/LiDAR/Point_MacKenzie/Point_Cloud/Classified">/LiDAR/Point_MacKenzie/Point_Cloud/Classified</a> las files. Anyone who got a copy of the data before July 6th should apply the fix to their local copy.

After releasing this mirror Martin Isenburg, developer of <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~isenburg/lastools/">LAStools</a> contacted the project and informed us of a small issue in the LAS files. 
</p>

<p>His message:
<i>
your "global encoding" bit seems to be set wrong in the file that I
downloaded (and probably in all other files as well). the GPS time is
negative and that means you are using adjusted GPS standard time and
that means that bit 0 of the global encoding field should be set, run
lasinfo.exe on the files to convince yourself or read the ASPRS LAS
1.3 specification.
</i>
</p>

<p>
This was confirmed and a fix was created to solve the issue.  The <a href="FixGlobalEncodingBit.zip">FixGlobalEncodingBit.zip</a> zip contains the fixer tool to go through the LAS files and correct the issue.   This tool was developed by Jason Mann at <a href="http://aerometric.com">aerometric</a>.  
</p>

<p>instructions for FixGlobalEncodingBit.z1p</a>
<pre>
1) Download the attached file and rename the extension to ".zip"
2) Extract the 2 files to a folder on your hard drive
3) Double-click the EXE file to launch the program
4) Load all of the LAS files into the processing queue
5) Click on "Process" --> "Fix Headers"

Should only take a few seconds to run through all the files.  I have tested 
on several files and read them into multiple software packages to ensure that 
the program is working correctly.
 
Regards
Jason
